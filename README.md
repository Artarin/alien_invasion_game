# Babilon 5 - alien_invasion_game
Game in Babilon5 setting. 
You may fly in four directions by arrows, firing with "space",
and teleport to the center bottom of screen with "t" button.
To exit, press "q" or "alt-f4".
every new fleet of enemies has +10% moving speed, but you too).

In this game i realized some new (for me) technical solutions, such as:
- dynamic ship speed, within the fps,
- converting game models sizes. You can use pictures in any size. Game code ransforms it.
- player ship missiles change colors (shades of blue) while it moving.

Project with pygame library
